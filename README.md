# Reinforcement Learning Tests

This repository contains a few reinforcement learning agents that I implemented as a personal exercise, mainly following Sutton and Barto's famous textbook and occasionally some online guides. My goal was to establish a foundation in reinforcement learning so the methods are basic but diverse. 

The examples are applied on various environments using the Gym library and some custom environments adapted from Sutton and Barto, such as Cliffworld.
