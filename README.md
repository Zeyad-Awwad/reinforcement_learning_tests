# Reinforcement Learning Tests

This repository contains a few reinforcement learning agents that I implemented as a personal exercise, mainly following Sutton and Barto's famous textbook and occasionally some online guides. None of these methods are new but they served as a useful introduction to (deep) reinforcement learning. 

The examples are applied on various environments using the Gym library and some custom environments adapted from Sutton and Barto, such as Cliffworld.
